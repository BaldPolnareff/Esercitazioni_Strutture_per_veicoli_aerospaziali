Type of Analysis (101 for Structural Static Analysis,  102 for Structural Static with Aerodynamic Load Analysis,  103 for Structural Modal Analysis,  144 for Aeroelastic Static Analysis)
   
Type of Theory (EULE, FSDT, EDTN). If theory type is EDTN, an other number compares; it represents the expansion order of EDTN theory (for example, for expansion order 3 the approximation functions will be: 1, x, z, x^2, xz, z^2, x^3, x^2z, xz^2, z^3)
   
Type of shape functions integration (fulint (full integration = classical Gauss integration), redint(reduced integration for all the terms), selint(selective integration = reduced integration only for shear terms))
   
Method used to solve the structural FEM system.
   
Notation_flag: flag for the notation used
       = 1 : notation with X_Local_Axis parallel to X_Glob_Axis for every Wing Segment
       = 2 : notation with X_Local_Axis in general not parallel to X_Glob_Axis for every Wing Segment
   
Number of Modes for the Modal Analysis
   
   
   
NOTE 1: in this it could be present the vaues of PENALTY NUMBERS:
    - Shear Penalty (on material coefficients C44 and C55) for only Euler Theory;
    - Penalty (on K(4,4), K(6,6), K(7,7), K(9,9), that are terms of Stiffness Matrix Block corresponding to i-th node and j-th node) for Euler, FSDT Theories;
    - Constraints Penalty (on K(i,i), that are terms on the Diagonal of Stiffness Matrix; they are corresponding to Constrainted Degrees of Freedom). Such a Constraint Penalty Number can be equal to the number for previous Penalty.
   
NOTE 2: Maybe it's better to put SHEAR PENALTY and PENALTY numbers in a Keyword class, or something similar.
